# lesson-plan-parser
Parses lesson plans and turns it into a CSV

---

Code is ***really*** messy, but it works!

Requires [PHP7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iW0B9NTId2g)
To run it, CD to whereever you have the files at and run `php -S localhost:8000` and goto `localhost:8000`.

This is a CSV form of my [Lesson Plan Organizer](https://github.com/MrAuro/lesson-plan-organizer).
Built to help organize homework for school.
